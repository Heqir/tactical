Tactical
========

A turn-based tactical roleplaying game in a fantasy setting. Inspired by xcom: enemy unknown

Cloning: `$ git clone https://github.com/Heqir/tactical.git`

### Project structure
Since we use [libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) we will get the following project structure:

* `tactical-main/` - The core project. All platform independent code goes here. 
* `tactical-pc/` - The desktop version.
* `tactical-android/` - The android version.
* `tactical-android/assets/` - All assets and resources go here.

### Team Guidelines
<dl>
  <dt>TDD</dt>
  <dd>Use Test Driven Development as much as possible.</dd>
  <dt>Documentation</dt>
  <dd>Write proper Javadoc, and GOOD COMMIT MESSAGES. Preferably one "thing" per commit.</dd>
  <dt>"Scrum"</dt>
  <dd>Relaxed scrum meetings every now and then. New features that are not on the priority list must be discussed at such meetings.</dd>
  <dt>Workflow</dt>
  <dd>Work in your own branch. Merge an updated master into your branch as soon as possible. Work iteratively. Get a bare bones version up and into master as soon as possible. Flesh it out later.</dd>
</dl>

### Code Convention
TODO’s come in three forms for this project:

* `TODOHIGH` (high priority)
* `TODONORM` (normal priority, recommended default)
* `TODOLOW` (low priority)
    
Defining `TODO`’s is really easy in Eclipse. Go to `Window -> Preferences` and search/filter for "task tags”. Then change the task names and priorities as wanted.

### About the authors
We are a bunch of Software Engineering students from Gothenburg, Sweden. We are mainly developing this game for fun, but figured we could also try out some of the techniques we learn in school.
